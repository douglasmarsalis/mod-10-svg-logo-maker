## [![License: APACHE2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License:_MIT-orange)](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)

## Description
* For this project, I will create an application that will enable a user to create a svg logo.
* This application will feature Node.js and use npm dependencies inquirer and jest.
* I will also test the application using jest and make sure that it passes the test.
* I will make sure that my code follows industry standards and is sourced correctly.
* By building this application, it has helped me to learn information on Node.js, npm, jest, svg, and other info.
## User Story
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
